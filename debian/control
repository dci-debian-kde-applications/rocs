Description: graph theory IDE
 Rocs aims to be a Graph Theory IDE for helping professors to show the results
 of a graph algorithm and also helping students to do the algorithms.
 .
 Rocs has a scripting module, done in Qt Script, that interacts with the drawn
 graph and every change in the graph with the script is reflected on the drawn
 one.
 .
 This package is part of the KDE education module.
