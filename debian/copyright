License: EPL-1
    THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
    PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF
    THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
 .
    1. DEFINITIONS
 .
    "Contribution" means:
 .
    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
    documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
 .
    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
 .
    i) changes to the Program, and
 .
    ii) additions to the Program;
 .
    where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and
    are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
    'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such
    Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
    Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are
    separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the
    Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative
    works of the Program.
 .
    "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
 .
    "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
    or when combined with the Program.
 .
    "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
    Agreement.
 .
    "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
    including all Contributors.
 .
    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
 .
    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
    license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
    publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
    Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and
    object code form.
 .
    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
    grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
    license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
    import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if
    any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall
    apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the
    time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the
    Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed
    Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
    which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed
    hereunder.
 .
    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
    licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
    provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
    patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
    Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
    any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights
    or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
    granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to
    secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For
    example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient
    to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire
    that license before distributing the Program.
 .
    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
    copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
    license set forth in this Agreement.
 .
    3. REQUIREMENTS
 .
    A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form
    under its own license agreement, provided that:
 .
    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
 .
    b) its license agreement:
 .
    i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties
    and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions
    of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of
    merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
 .
    ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability
    for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
    consequential damages, such as lost profits;
 .
    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
    offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
 .
    iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
    Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
    manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
 .
    When the Program is made available in source code form:
 .
    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
 .
    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
    Program.
 .
    Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
    within the Program.
 .
    Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
    Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
    Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
 .
    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
 .
    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
    ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
    other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
    damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the
    Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions
    of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of
    the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this
    section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or
    alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an
    Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
    Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial
    Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor
    in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The
    Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own
    expense.
 .
    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
    performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
    Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
    must pay those damages.

    5. NO WARRANTY
 .
    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
    PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
    KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
    WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible
    for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the
    Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights
    under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs
    of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss
    of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of
    operations.
 .
    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
 .
    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR
    ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
    INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
    WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
    LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
    NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
    DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
    HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
    7. GENERAL
 .
    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
 .
    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including
    a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
    itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
    hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
    litigation is filed.
 .
    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails
    to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time
    after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights
    under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and
    distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However,
    Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted
    by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
 .
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
    distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions)
    may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under
    which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the
    Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program
    (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as
    expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no
    rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor
    under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or
    otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this
    Agreement are reserved.
 .
    This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
    intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to
    this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than
    one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights
    to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.
